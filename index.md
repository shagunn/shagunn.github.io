I’m a software engineer living in the Bay Area. I'm interested in making machine learning systems work in the real world. Things that excite me: search and optimization (making it easier to find and use good information), biotechnology, healthcare systems. 

<br/>
Previously,


* I developed ML models at TrueML to help create better experiences for consumers seeking financial health.
* Worked as a ML Engineer at Boston Children’s Hospital doing COVID-19 modelling in collaboration with Moderna. 
<!-- * Worked as a machine learning engineer at TrueML helping build better experiences for consumers seeking financial health and at Boston Children’s Hospital doing COVID-19 modelling in collaboration with Moderna.  -->
* Spent time as a machine learning researcher at ICES Ontario and the Population Health Analytics Lab, where I developed ML models for cardiac care and health resource planning. 
* Developed and launched a robotics program for kids with disabilities at [Holland Bloorview Hospital](https://hollandbloorview.ca/services/programs-services/robotics). The program has been running for over 5 years now.  
* Hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro and helped raise money for [Haymu Primary School in Tanzania](https://www.fotzc.org/education-completed-projects).

I graduated with an M.A.Sc. in Engineering from the University of Toronto, where I was advised by Scott Sanner in the Data-Driven Decision Making Lab. Before that, I completed my H.B.Sc. in Molecular Genetics and Neuroscience, focusing my thesis work on exploring the neuromodulation of locomotory circuits in C. elegans.

Other interests: hiking, skiing, reading, creating digital art & baking.
